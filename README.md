# Protection-of-File-System-in-OS-using-DES-Algorithm

Objective:<br>
➢ Understanding the need of data security and integrity to be included during design of distributed operating system.<br>
➢ Types of cryptography modules used by different operating system store data and authorize users.<br>
➢ Implement a file encryption technique using DES for the windows platform.<br>
➢ Comparing the time and space aspects of decrypted file and encrypted file.<br>

ABOUT DES<br>
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).<br>
DES is an implementation of a Feistel Cipher. <br>
It uses 16 round Feistel structure. <br>
The block size is 64-bit. <br>
Though, key length is 64-bit, DES has an effective key length of 56 bits, since 8 of the 64 bits of the key are not used by the encryption algorithm (function as check bits only).<br>

SCOPE:<br>
• First of all user fulfill the agreement form of this program then user insert a text massage or include text massage file.<br>
• Encryption key as an input as a result, this program will encrypt and decrypt this text massage and save it in a file.<br>
